Version 0.5 - By Guy Markman

Please read the entire README before installing.
WARNING: Pre-Release, changes may be introduced until the release of the release version. 

Hi everyone! 
After I have seen that my favorite airstrip (sorry LLMG) doesn't have a good scenery for XP11, I've decided to upgrade it to a much better scenery.
Because the airstrip doesn't have any building (from what I've heard from people who've visited the airstrip recently) and because I wanted to leave it as simple as possible, I've decided to make it using only Laminar Libraries so I'll update the one on the Gateway on the way.

BUT!

I'm not sure how realistic it is, so I've decided to give you (!) VatIL member, the people who probably know the most how realistic it should be, a look! It is a chance to check it and give me comments and feedbacks before I'm uploading it to Gateway and releaseing it to the rest of the world.
Althought I've uploaded it using GitHub, so I'll be able to update it easily and update it frequently, I would be glad if you won't share the link to GitHub or the files themselves to the world, until I'll decided that it is ready.
You can share the link  to the VATIL forum for VATIL members and I would be glad if you'll do it. 

Installation: 

- Delete any kind of scenery you have for LLMZ (Incullding mine if you're updating) 

- Extract the file to Custom Scenery folder 

- Please make sure that in the scenery_packs.ini file   

SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/IXPT Ben Gurion LLBG/ 

is *HIGHER* than

SCENERY_PACK Custom Scenery/Global Airports/
